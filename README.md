## Project Summary

**Weather-ReactVite** is a fast, minimal, and modern weather web application built with React and Vite. It lets users search any city in the world and view up-to-date weather details including temperature, humidity, and wind information using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). Designed for learning and demonstration, this project is ideal for beginners and intermediates who want to understand how to build and deploy a real-world React app with API integration and Vercel deployment.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1. Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnobt78/Weather--ReactVite.git
cd Weather--ReactVite
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
This installs all required packages from `package.json`.

---

### 4. Get OpenWeather API Key

- Register for free at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
- Get your API key from your dashboard.

---

### 5. Run the App Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

---

## How It Works

1. **Search for a City**: Type a city name and submit.
2. **API Request**: The app fetches weather data for the city using OpenWeather API.
3. **Display Data**: Weather details (temperature, humidity, wind, status) are shown.
4. **Responsive UI**: The design adapts to your device for a seamless experience.

---

## API Integration

This app uses the **OpenWeather API** to fetch weather data. You’ll need an API key to use it.

**Basic fetch example:**

```js
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`;

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Use data.main.temp, data.weather[0].description, etc.
  });
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example: Main Weather Fetch Function

```jsx
async function fetchWeather(city) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  // Display data.main.temp, data.weather[0].description, etc.
}
```

### Example: Simple Weather Card Component

```jsx
function WeatherCard({ city, temp, humidity, wind, status }) {
  return (
    <div className="weather-card">
      <h2>{city}</h2>
      <p>{status}</p>
      <p>Temperature: {temp}°C</p>
      <p>Humidity: {humidity}%</p>
      <p>Wind: {wind} m/s</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
